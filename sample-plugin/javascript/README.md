### Sample JS Plugin

This is a sample plugin using vanilla javascript with sample query/mutation.

It uses babel and webpack to be compatible with the autogenerated `ts` files in the `w3` files (once you run `build` command).

You can add new functionalities to it by following steps.

1. Add queries/mutations in the `schema.graphql` file in the respective folder.

   This means that, if you want to add a new query, you should go to `query/schema.graphql` file and add it there

2. Add resolvers for that in the `index.js` file of the respective folder.

   This means that, if, for example, you want to add a new mutation (remember that you previously should have added the mutation in the `mutation/schema.graphql` file). You then should go to `mutation/index.js` and implement that function inside of the `Mutation` class

3. Run `yarn build`

To see how you can interact/use it, you can check the [test file](./src/__tests__/e2e.spec.js) and run `yarn test`
